He was once a Temple Guard, sworn to protect the Exemplarate, and perfect the art of martial combat. He's normally very calm, rational, and friendly... however, when wounded, or when those he's protecting are threatened, he sinks into a sort of Battle Fury, which clouds his mind with rage. Fearing his loss of control, and for the safety of the Temple, he left on a quest to discipline his instincts. His trip to Dossent makes this the first time he's been back to a Temple in a very long time.

* Bloodrage: When threatened, you may fly into a berserk rage as a Free Action, gaining +2 STR and DEX, and -2 INT and WIS. While enraged you become irrational, and are compelled to attack any known threats, unless you succeed at a DC 10 Wisdom Check. You cannot end the rage until no known threats remain, or you succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom Check. The rage ends if you've been enraged for more than your CON score in minutes, or if you are fatigued or unconscious. When the rage ends, you are fatigued (and may only take 1 Simple Action per turn), for the same number of rounds spent in a rage.
* Defensive Counter: When using Defense against a melee attacker, if the attacker doesn't beat your Dodge rating, you may make an immediate counter attack against them as a Free Action.
