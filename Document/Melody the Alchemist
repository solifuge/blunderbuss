Special Abilities:
* Nimble: Elven racial ability. You recieve a +2 bonus to Acrobatics checks, and +1 to Dodge/Defense.
* Fey Bloodline: Elven racial ability. You may cast spells as with the Wild Arcana special ability, using your CHA bonus as your Casting Ability bonus for Arcana checks. Casting a spell requires a Complex Action, combining the effects of any Words of Power you know into a spell. Your Arcana check must be higher than (5 + 5 per Effect Word + Total Spellpower of the spell) in order to cast successfully. If you fail, you take Non-Lethal Damage equal to the Spellpower of the spell attempted. You may only attempt spells with a maximum Spellpower equal to 1 + your CHA bonus. 
* Tree Kin: Elven racial ability. So long as you are exposed to natural sunlight for 8 hours in a day, you can sustain yourself on water and a few bites of food. You prefer to eat when possible, but tend toward smaller meals. You are also unable to sleep, though you may choose to meditate in a dreamlike state while your body is resting.
* Knowledgeable: You may attempt Lore skill checks, even when you are not trained in a specific Lore skill. Untrained Lore checks receive a +1 bonus for every Lore skill among your Major Skills, and every 2 Lore skills among your Minor Skills.
