[center][table][tr][td][center][hr][color=#868686]You stand up, a little shakey at first. Legs feel wobbly. Head does, too.
You see a [b]Stray Ukulele[/b] nearby. You assume it might be yours, but...

[abbr=Ouch...][img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solifuge/ashwoodcross/master/image/splash/1_stand.png[/img][/abbr]

When you [color=transparent][glow=#868686,1]think about that, your head starts to feel really weird[/glow][/color].
The thoughts just [color=transparent][glow=#8668686,1]sputter out into unrelated things[/glow][/color].

Until your memory is trying to be a smell, and .

is trying to be a decision or an emotion. Everything just gets [color=transparent][glow=#8668686,1]blurred[/glow][/color] together into nonsense.

You don't remember it being yours, but you choose to adopt it.

[table][tr][td][center][hr][color=#868686]It's nice to be united with your precious, [b]Nameless Ukulele[/b].

To be honest, though, you're still feeling pretty crappy.

You take a moment to assess your [b]Current Condition[/b].[/color][/center][/td][/tr][/table][/center]

This is no Tootsie Roll. It's your [b]Duffel Bag[/b].

At least, it's presumably your bag? I mean, it's here with you, and there's no one else around. Right?
When you try to think back and remember anything about it, your head starts to get [color=transparent][glow=#666666,1]All Fuzzy[/glow][/color] again.
This seems to happen whenever you try to remember things.

What do you think's inside?[/color][/center][/td][/tr][/table][/center]
