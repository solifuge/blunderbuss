Homesteader is happy you forget in a Look On The Bright Side way.
You get to look at everything with fresh eyes!

"You went on Walkabout again. I was worried you'd gotten tired of our hospitality!"

DO THEY EVEN KNOW YOU? ARE YOU TECHNICALLY NEW TO THIS TIMELINE? MEETING FOLKS FOR FIRST TIME?

On tell about cave adventures, when you get to the dream sequence?

Oh, you Foundlings are lucky, with your vivid dreams. Poor Sylvans can't dream at all!

Have you ever wondered why Humans only seem to dream of other Humans?
It always struck me as rather xenophobic, to be frank...
...but oh, what am I saying! Tell me more about your day.







Hana investigates Lore regarding Lucity, and the crisis, with smart and canny folks in Ashwood Cross (hence having to go there).

DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT YOU WILLED ITEMS AND IDENTITY INTO EXISTANCE? MOLDED MATTER INTO YOUR HUMAN BODY, TO MATCH YOUR MEMORIES?
Are very powerful, when tapped into the immense will your Eidolon had/has.

LETTERS ARE NEVER TRANSLATED. MUST BE TRANSLATED BY PLAYERS
PLAYERS ARE SYMBOLIC OF THE EIDOLON SHARDS IN HANA RECIEVING
AND TRANSLATING THE MESSAGE FROM DREAMSPACE, AS SENT BY LUCITY.

IMAGE VERSION:
==============
Hey Hana.
It's me, Hana.
Yeah, it's weird
for me too.

Maybe you knew
That already
And maybe you
Didn't.

...

REDUX:
======

So, I'm in a bad spot. Maybe you know already?
Either way, I've got to be quick. Don't know how long I have.
A lot just happened. But I'm doing my best to look forward.


HANA DREAM LETTER 1:
====================
Hey, you. It's me.

You, too.

Yeah, I know. It's just as weird for me.

So, I'm in a bad spot. Maybe you know already?
Either way, I've got to be quick. Don't know how long I have.

Bad things are going to start happening.
First, the earthquakes. Then, the stars go dark.
Then, a big flash, and a wall of light that sweeps in from the horizon.
Then nothing. Ashwood, the land, the sky... everyone and everything, gone.
A dead wind blowing through a big white Nothing.

Eventually, things go back and repeat themselves. It's some kind of loop.
We still don't know why, or how far back it goes.
No one remembers. I don't really, either. That's a part of the loop.
And it's something we're trying to change.

Look, I know that this sounds crazy. And it is crazy.
Wish I could think of a clever way to prove it, but I've got nothing.
I know that you're dreaming right now, but that doesn't help things.
You might think this is another part of your dream. Or that this note isn't real.
But it is real. Or, it was. Something about dreaming lets us remember.

Like I said, it's weird. And I'm sorry to ramble.
A lot just happened. But I'm doing my best to look forward.

Anyway, we found a possible solution.
Or at least something that gives us a chance to find a solution.
But it's not been easy getting here, and I'm not ready for what's next.
I could use someone else to talk to, right now.
I guess a different Me works too, LOL.

Seriously, though. If you can, write me back. There's some space at the bottom.
Let me know that you got this. That you're okay. That this won't be for nothing.

Then bring this letter through the gate, to Lucity.
They'll know how to get it to me.


OVER TIME:
==========
Write more letters to your future self (maybe from a failed timeline?)
Have correspondence about your adventures, summarizing your exploits and stuff.
These give your past self the courage to go through with it.
Explore this through a vignette.


Chronology:
In order to progress through City of Forever, or store up energy, Future-Player-Hana must buy more time.
Future-Player-Hana uses minimal energy reserves in City of Forever to initiate Time Loop.
Antagonized by the confused and grieving Eidolons of the beings who created the City and destroyed their homeworld.
Want to tear the city apart, expell you, keep you from using it to doom yourself.
Mad beings, blind to reason or whatever.
DO YOU HAVE A SYMPATHETIC EIDOLON ALLY?

Time Loop iterates, while foggy awareness of it filters in through Dreams.
After awareness, Hana and Co. concoct plan to help her become an Eidolon Host, to retain memories across Time Loops.
<HANA GAINS SECOND SOUL, TIME LOOPS, GAME BEGINS>
Hana investigates Loop at behest of her Alternate Self.

Eventually, Hana finds City, initiates Time Loop. SEE ABOVE.
TODO: This somehow enables a later escape for everyone.






OLD LETTER DRAFT:
=================
Hey Hana. It's me, Hana.
Don't ask how, I don't get it either.

So hey, you were stuck in a [b]Time Loop[/b] of some kind.
An [b]Extremely Shitty[/b] kind.
Maybe end of the world stuff?
But sorta like that movie about the Guy and the Groundhog.
Remember that thing? No one here has seen it. Or any film-reels.
You'd think [b]Earth Culture[/b] would be more popular with these people.
Waste of a good reference.

Anyway, maybe you knew the loop thing already?
I didn't, until recently.
Unlike the movie, part of being in the [b]Time Loop[/b] meant not remembering.
But when you dream[, you can sorta remember? Almost?
Dreams are weird like that.
Like I said, I don't get it.

But what [b]You[/b] are about to get is a [b]Hot Tip[/b].
From your sexy and mysterious [b]Alter Ego[/b].
(That's me)
A way to sort this out. Or at least buy us a chance.
But hey, I'll be honest. It's not a good way.

I don't know how many times we looped.
Don't have a lot of information, honestly.
All the forgetting...
That's part of why I've got to do this thing.
I'm mostly just writing because I'm nervous.
About what I've gotta do.
About what if this doesn't work. 
Got maybe an hour, before the next Loop wipes these memories.
I need to make the call.

Fuck. Like this was ever really a choice.

Hey, on the off chance that I'm not you in the morning.
That I'm wherever people go when timelines erase 'em.
That you're an Other-Me, I guess?

Shit, sorry. Had to step away.
This is pretty heavy.

Look, just promise me you'll figure this out, okay?
That you'll do whatever it takes to get yourself out of this.

And if I'm not me, well.
I guess it's your turn, Other-Me.
I had a pretty good run.
Good times, bad times. Got up to some wild shit.
If you don't remember, guess you'll have to ask me about it some time.

Lol.

Anyway, time to go act a fool.
Good luck, much love, and go kick some ass.
