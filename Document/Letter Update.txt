It's Mouser! Last time you saw them was at Grenfeldon's alchemy stall in the Market.
It's only been a few hours... and yet it feels so long ago.

I nearly forgot why that cat-kitty was familiar, and there it is! In your avatar and on the window! :P[/quote]

"Avatar"? No no no, "Familiar". A little play on words, to entertain yourself.
On account of the fact that this Cat happens to be a Familiar.

A Wizard's fabled animal helper, in times of yore.
Smarter than a beast ought to be. Dangerously smart.

Borderline Magical, thanks to the Second Soul they've got.
An Eidolon, escaped from The Astral, and bonded to a mortal critter.
Wise guardians from the deepest wilderness.
Sadistic monsters who toy with lost travellers.

This one does deliveries, and steals your socks.
Basically, Mouser is a Magic Car. A [i]slightly illegal[/i] Magic Cat.
But it's not their fault. It's just how they are.

Anyway, it looks like the Professor sent Mouser to you with a message.

You open the letter, and start to read...

[table][tr][td][hr][b]Melody, be advised.

Flind Courier returned, made
change of plans. 

Picking up explosives delivery
for Stonebreaker Quarry.
Compound prepared, in lab;
Please bring upstairs.

Celise requested spare Lab Key;
If locked, see her or Torrence.

Tidy up the usual odds and ends
before our guest arrives.
You know how the others are.

In finer script at the bottom, as though added as an afterthought, the letter continues.

[table][tr][td][hr][b]
P.S. Appologies for the sass earlier, deserved or no.
Didn't mean to embarass you.

You're my most gifted student, and a reliable assistant.
I'm very lucky to have you around. You could go anywhere,
and do anything you wanted, with your talents.

Put your best foot forward this afternoon, and always;
you represent us all!
