[b][u]OVERVIEW:[/u][/b]
Blunderbuss is a d20-style Suggestion Game set in the midst of a Fantasy Renaissance, where gunpowder, steam, and sorcery coexist. Feel free to review the adventure in the Table of Contents above, post a suggestion for the characters in the latest update, or read a bunch of the rules stuff in the spoilers below, depending on what you're into.

[i]** The Darkling Forum Theme is recommended when viewing this adventure, which users can switch to [url=http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;area=theme]here[/url].[/i]


[b][u]DA RULES:[/u][/b]
This suggestion game uses a homebrew d20 system. Most of the time, you can just suggest actions, and I'll pick my favorite or the most popular ones. When a character does something with a chance for failure, we make a Skill Check to see if they succeed. We roll a 20-sided die, add relevant Skill Training and Ability Score bonuses (or penalties if negative) to the result, and see if it beats a hidden Difficulty score set by me. Rolling a 20 results in a Critical Success, which results in the best possible outcome. Rolling a 1 results in a Critical Failure, where the action backfires... often spectacularly.

Rules will be handled by me, and most are explained either through gameplay or in rollover Alt Text on the images. For the curious and particularly brave, I've included some more complete game rules below. I wouldn't advise reading through the whole thing, but feel free to consult it as things come up. If anything's worded strangely or doesn't make sense, let me know, and I'll try to clarify.

[spoiler=Character Stats:]Ability scores measure a character's innate physical and mental abilities, and add a bonus (or penalty if negative) to all skill tests related to them. Each ability score begins at 0 [Average], and you may buy a bonus by spending Ability Points. You begin with 10 Ability Points to spend, but you may decrease an ability score below 0, gaining points to spend on other ability scores:

[tt][u]Skill Rating    Point Cost[/u]
-2 [Terrible]   Gain 3 pts.
-1 [Poor]       Gain 1 pt.
*0 [Average]    ------
+1 [Fair]       Costs 1 pt.
+2 [Good]       Costs 3 pts.
+3 [Great]      Costs 6 pts.
+4 [Superb]     Costs 10 pts.[/tt]
[list][li][b]Strength (STR):[/b] Measures muscle and physical power. It factors into melee attacks, carrying capacity, and tests where brawn is key.
[*][b]Dexterity (DEX):[/b] Measures agility, reflexes, and balance. It factors into ranged attacks, defense checks, and tests where finesse is key.
[*][b]Constitution (CON):[/b] Measures fitness and stamina. It factors into hit points, and tests where health and endurance are key.
[*][b]Intelligence (INT):[/b] Represents ability to learn and reason. Determines how many skills you've learned, and tests where knowledge and logic are key.
[*][b]Wisdom (WIS):[/b] Represents willpower and awareness. Factors into perception, luck, and tests where common sense and intuition are key.
[*][b]Charisma (CHA):[/b] Represents likability and force of character. Factors into social skills, and tests where influence and personality are key.[/li][/list]

[b]Health:[/b] Start with (8 ± CON) maximum Health Points. These recover after a day's rest. At 0 your character has been Wounded, and may die. Wounds take medical treatment and time to recover.
[b]Inventory:[/b] Start with (8 ± STR) Item Slots. Small objects take up 1 slot, and Large objects take up 2. Oversized objects may take up more. Carried containers can grant you additional inventory space.

[b]Dodge:[/b] Equal to (10 ± DEX), plus certain equipment and special bonuses. Attack rolls must beat this number in order to hit you. After the first attack, every subsequent attack in a round reduces Dodge by -2.
[b]Armor:[/b] Determined by the armor you wear. All damage is reduced by your Armor before being subtracted from HP.
[b]Maximum Mobility:[/b] Heavier armor impedes movement, making it harder to dodge, and use certain skills. The Ability Score bonuses to these Skill Checks and to Dodge may not exceed the Max Mobility of any worn armor. This does not limit bonuses not granted by Ability Scores, such as from equipment or skill training. Affected skills include Acrobatics, Athletics, Climb, Defense, Stealth, Swim, and Arcana.

[b]Major Skills:[/b] Start with (4 ± INT) Major Skills from the list below. These grant a +5 to related skill checks.
[b]Minor Skills:[/b] Start with (4 ± INT) Minor Skills from the list below. These grant a +3 to related skill checks.
[b]Special Abilities:[/b] Start with 1 Special Ability you qualify for, from the list below.
[b]Wealth:[/b] Start with (20 + 10xCHA) Silver Coins.[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Skills and Skill Checks]Skills represent your learned abilities used to perform different tasks, from climbing walls to healing wounds. Making a Skill Check is done by rolling a d20, adding the relevant Attribute and Skill Bonuses, and trying to beat a hidden difficulty score. Major Skills receive a +5, and Minor Skills receive a +3. You can attempt to use most skills if they aren't one of your Major or Minor skills, but you can't use Specialized Skills such as Lore, Pilot, Arcana, and so on if untrained in them.

Difficulty Scores for tasks are as follows:
[list][li]10 is a routine task, like shooting a game animal at close range, or recalling basic information about recent history.
[*]15 is a challenging task, like swimming against a strong current, or jumping an alleyway between rooftops.
[*]20 is a difficult task, like finding water in the desert, or identifying ancient ruins by their architectural style.
[*]25 is a very difficult task, like parrying a master swordsman's attack, or performing invasive surgery.
[*]30 is a monumental task, like climbing a 20-foot wall of sheer ice, or steering a damaged galleon out of a whirlpool.
[*]35 is a near-impossible task, like spotting a yellow needle hidden in a haystack, or hiding yourself from a passing army in a wide-open clearing.[/li][/list]

[spoiler=Time and Rounds in Combat]At most times, you can perform however many actions you want to. Sometimes the time an action takes to complete is important, such as in combat. In these situations, the game enters Rounds. Each character must make a DEX check each round, and actions resolve in order from highest to lowest. Characters can take 2 Simple Actions or 1 Complex Action each round, and may take as many Free Actions as is reasonable. I'll figure out action types when taking suggestions, but here's a quick reference:
[list][li][b]Free Actions[/b] are quick and effortless, such as dropping an object, dodging an attack, moving a short distance, or saying a few words.
[*][b]Simple Actions[/b] require only partial attention, such as equipping an object, hiding yourself from view, using a shield to block an attack, moving more than 5 feet, or attacking with a weapon.
[*][b]Complex Actions[/b] require most of your focus for several seconds, such as sprinting, climbing a rope, taking a Full Defense stance, loading a firearm, casting a spell, or arguing a point.[/li][/list][/spoiler]
[spoiler=Wounds and Dying:]Health can not be reduced below 0, but whenever a character is dealt damage that would reduced them to 0 HP or lower, they must roll on the Wound table, and must make a CON check to resist Dying (Difficulty 10 + 1 per HP damage dealt beyond 0). Success means they remain stable, while failure means they begin Dying, and take 1 point of CON damage.

[u]Dying:[/u]
A Dying creature may take only Free Actions and a single Simple Action each round. Any time they perform a strenuous activity, they must succeed at another CON check as above, or take 1 point of CON damage. Taking damage that would reduce them to 0 HP or lower provokes the CON check as well, and they may take Wounds as normal. If a creature takes enough CON damage to reduce them to -5, they are dead. CON damage is also dealt by suffocation, blood loss, starvation, sickness, poison, dehydration, and mortal wounds.

[u]Stabilization:[/u]
Once per minute, a Dying creature must attempt a CON check to end the Dying condition. Failure deals 1 point of CON damage, but success means they have stabilized and stopped Dying, though any Wounds, HP, and CON damage remains. Temporary hit points do not end the Dying condition, though a successful Difficulty 15 Medicine check, or supernatural HP restoration, will stabilize the creature and end the Dying condition.

[u]Non-Lethal Damage:[/u]
If reduced to 0 HP or lower by a source of Non-Lethal damage, a creature that fails their CON check falls Unconscious instead of Dying. Once per minute, you must attempt a CON check, to see if you are able to regain consciousness. While Unconscious, further Non-Lethal damage is treated as Lethal damage.

[u]Massive Damage:[/u]
Receiving massive damage from a single source (even Non-Lethal) can inflict a Wound, and deal CON damage. Taking 2x your Max HP in damage from one source causes you to take 1 CON damage and begin Dying. 3x your Max HP deals 2 CON damage, 4x deals 3 CON damage, and so on.

[u]Wounds:[/u]
Wounds are long-term debilitating effects, such as broken limbs or concussions, which take time and medical care to recover from. Serious wounds, or improper medical care may result in permanent injuries, such as blinded eyes or ruined limbs, which may never fully heal. A successful Medicine skill check, and a period of recovery time, is required to recover from a Wound, with Medicine check difficulty and recovery time depending on the severity of the Wound.

When wounded, roll 2d6, and consult the following table:
[list][li]12-10: No Wound
[*]9-5: Normal Wound - Medicine DC 15+. Takes days to recover.
[*]4-3: Severe Wound - Medicine DC 20+. Takes weeks to recover.
[*]2: Mortal Wound - Medicine DC 25+. Takes months to recover.[/li][/list][/spoiler]

[spoiler=Spellcasting Overview:]
Casting spells requires 3 things: Knowledge of the necessary Power Words, a Racial Ability or Special Ability that allows you access to Astral Energy, and training in the Arcana skill tied to those Power Words. The nature of spell creation and preparation, the effect of casting failure, and the Ability Score Bonus you add to your Arcana Checks depends on the Special Ability that grants you access to Astral Energy. In general, the act of casting a spell requires a Complex Action and a successful Arcana Skill Check; your Arcana Check result must be higher than (the Total Spellpower of the spell + 5 per Power Word involved) to succeed.

[u]Power Words:[/u]
Power Words are single syllables from the language of Magick. These are combined into spells, which allow creatures to alter reality or perceptions in different ways. Each spell must contain at least 1 Effect Word. Spells without a Spellform Word target the caster, and create a 5' area of effect around them if appropriate. Power Words are grouped into several categories:
  * [b]Spellform Words:[/b] Define how the spell behaves, who or what it can affect, etc.
  * [b]Effect Words:[/b] Define what the spell does to its targets.
  * [b]Metawords:[/b] Amplify or alter how the other Power Words in a spell behave.

[u]Accessing Astral Energy:[/u]
Just speaking a Power Word can't alter reality on its own; it also requires access to energies from the currents of The Astral. Though creatures such as Elves and Daemons have an innate connection to The Astral, there are several established methods by which other creatures can still gain access to these energies, and use them to weave Spells:
  * [b]Ritual Arcana:[/b] Intelligence-based, formulaic spellcasting, which relies on magickally-attuned implements or animals to channel Astral Energy. Cast spells without cost or limits, but only from spells prepared and bound to a talisman or familiar ahead of time.
  * [b]Pact Arcana:[/b] Wisdom-based spellcasting, which draws Astral Energy from a powerful supernatural ally, such as a Daemon. Cast spells flexibly, with no cost for failure, but only from a limited power pool granted through continued allegiance to your chosen patron.
  * [b]Wild Arcana:[/b] Charisma-based innate spellcasting, which requires an Astral Spirit to be bound to your body, and allows you to weave spells as magickal creatures do. Cast freely and instantly, but spells you fail to control can cause you physical harm.

[u]Spellpower (SP):[/u]
Spellpower is the measure of how much Astral Energy is required to fuel a spell. Each Power Word that makes up a spell has a Spellpower associated with it, which increases the total SP of the spell, and makes it more difficult to cast. Most Power Words have optional effects, which can change or enhance that Power Word, but further increase the Spellpower of the spell.

[u]Spheres of Magick, and the Arcana Skill:[/u]
Arcana is a specialized skill, and is taken multiple times for each Sphere of Magick. In order to cast a spell using an Effect Word, you must be trained in the Arcana Skill Specialization related to the Sphere that Effect Word belongs to. The Spheres of Magick, as presently known, include:
  * Conjuration: The manifestation of elemental and physical matter. Effects include creating invisible barriers, summoning Astral Spirits into physical forms, and temporary creation of elemental air, water, fire, or earth.
  * Evocation: The manipulation of energy and vital forces. Effects include creating electrical or caustic energy, resisting extreme heat or cold, and manipulating life energy.
  * Illusion: Manipulation of perceptions and the mind. Effects include making objects invisible, creating false images, sharing or manipulating the senses, and altering memories.
  * Transmutation: The manipulation of physical bodies and matter. Effects include granting inanimate objects false life, manipulation of gravity, and changing the form of an object or creature.

When making an Arcana Check to cast a spell, you must use the Arcana Skill related to the Sphere of the Effect Words in the spell. If the spell contains Effect Words from multiple Spheres (such 1 Illusion Effect and 1 Transmutation Effect), you must be trained in Arcana Skill Specializations for each of those Spheres, and you use the lowest related Arcana Skill in your attempt to cast the spell.

[u]Dodging and Resisting Spells:[/u]
When casting a spell with a Spellform that requires an Attack check (such as with a melee, marksmanship, or throwing attack), the spell must only make contact with the target in order to affect them. As long as the Spell Attack beats their Dodge Score, these spells will take effect.

Some Spell Effects can be resisted by their target, if they succeed at a Saving Throw. A Saving Throw is made with a d20 roll + one of your ability scores; the ability score that resists an effect is listed in each Effect Word. Some effects can't be resisted, while others can only be partially resisted for a reduced effect, listed in each Effect Word. The DC your Saving Throw must beat to resist a spell is equal to (10 + the caster's Casting Ability Score Bonus + 1 per Power Word the spell contains).

[u]Spellcasting Definitions:[/u]
[b]Casting Ability Bonus:[/b] The Ability Score bonus you add to your Arcana Checks.

[b]Short Range:[/b] 10' x Casting Ability Bonus (CHA/INT/WIS)
[b]Medium Range:[/b] 25' x Casting Ability Bonus (CHA/INT/WIS)
[b]Long Range:[/b] 100' x Casting Ability Bonus (CHA/INT/WIS)

[b]Caster:[/b] The creature that casts the spell from Power Words they know.
[b]Source:[/b] The creature, object, or location from which the spell effect originates.
[b]Target:[/b] The creature or object that the spell's Words of Effect are attempting to affect.

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Known Spellform Words]
[u]Bolt (Target, 0 Spellpower):[/u]
Make a Marksmanship Attack against one target within Medium Range. If you succeed, the spell affects the target, and creates a 5' area of effect centered on target if appropriate. Defense checks do not apply.
+1 SP: Far - Range increases to Long Range.
+2 SP: Mass - You may cast the spell multiple times, making an additional Ranged Attack for every +2 of your Casting Attribute bonus. You may aim multiple attacks against any target in range, and their effects are cumulative.

[u]Select (Target, 1 Spellpower):[/u]
Spell affects one target within Close Range, and creates a 5' area of effect centered on target if appropriate.
+1 SP: Far - Range increases to Medium Range.
+2 SP: Mass - Spell affects one target per Casting Attribute bonus, all of which must be within Close Range of each other.

[/spoiler]
[spoiler=Known Conjuration Effect Words:]
[u]Aegis (Conjuration, 2 Spellpower):[/u]
Creates a shell of force around the target which protects against incoming attacks, granting a +2 bonus to Dodge and Defense. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds.
+1 SP: Extended - This effect lasts for 1 minute per Casting Ability bonus.
+2 SP: Hardened - This effect also grants +2 to the target's Armor Rating, reducing physical damage taken by 2.

[u]Light (Conjuration, 1 Spellpower):[/u]
