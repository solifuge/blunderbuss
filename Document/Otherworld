The Otherworld:
Home to the Fey, this paralell world is seen as an early prototype for the world.
Time does not pass as normal, and nothing ages while in The Otherworld. 100 years spent there may pass as a day in the world.
Similarly, all of its native beings exist out of the cycle of life and death. They are immortal after a fashion, living out multiple permutations of their lives; even when slain, they are likely to reemerge elsewhere.
